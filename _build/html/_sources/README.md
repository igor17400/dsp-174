## WHAT TO EXPECT:

This work aims to provide a summary of signal processing that achieves a balance, as indicated by the title—not overly concise yet not as exhaustive as a comprehensive textbook. My intention was to explore essential content with more depth than a typical summary offers, yet not as extensively as a canonical textbook. At the same time, the idea is to combine several high-quality tutorials available online, which might be helpful in understanding and gaining a clear vision of signal processing. While this isn’t just a collection of equations, it also isn’t a book or paper that aims to make a significant contribution. Ultimately, my goal is to present a practical approach to signal processing that may be useful for those trying to better understand this subject. In any case, I hope this proves helpful to someone beyond myself. If you’ve read this far, thank you, and stay safe!
