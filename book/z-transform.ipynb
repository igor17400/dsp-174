    "The Z-transform is an essential tool for analyzing discrete-time signals and systems. Similar to the Laplace transform for continuous systems, the Z-transform converts a time-domain sequence into a complex frequency-domain representation. This transformation simplifies the analysis and design of digital filters, control systems, and other discrete-time processes.\n",

    "## Properties of the Z-Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Laplace transform, the Z-transform has several properties that are valuable when analyzing discrete-time systems. These properties provide insights into the time and frequency behavior of the sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:theorem}\n",
    "**Linearity of the Z-Transform**: If $a$ and $b$ are constants, and $x[n]$ and $y[n]$ are discrete-time sequences, then the Z-transform of a linear combination is given by:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\mathcal{Z}\\{a x[n] + b y[n]\\} = a X(z) + b Y(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property shows that the Z-transform of a sum of scaled sequences is equal to the sum of their individual transforms, each scaled accordingly.\n",

    "> <span style=\"margin-left: 0.25cm; color: #FFC0D9; font-size: 1.5em;\">&rarr;</span> The Z-transform converts linear difference equations into algebraic equations, simplifying the process of solving them in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:theorem}\n",
    "**Time Shifting Property**: If $\\mathcal{Z}\\{x[n]\\} = X(z)$, then the Z-transform of a shifted sequence $x[n-k]$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{Z}\\{x[n-k]\\} = z^{-k} X(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is useful for analyzing delayed sequences and determining how a time shift in the sequence affects its frequency-domain representation.\n",

    "````{prf:theorem}\n",
    "**Convolution Property**: If $x[n]$ and $h[n]$ are two discrete-time sequences with Z-transforms $X(z)$ and $H(z)$, then the Z-transform of their convolution $(x * h)[n]$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{Z}\\{(x * h)[n]\\} = X(z) H(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property states that the convolution of two sequences in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "This property is particularly useful in digital signal processing, as it simplifies filtering operations by converting them into simple multiplications.\n",

    "> <span style=\"margin-left: 0.25cm; color: #FFC0D9; font-size: 1.5em;\">&rarr;</span> Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain, making the Z-transform a powerful tool for analyzing linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Region of Convergence (ROC)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the unique features of the Z-transform is the **Region of Convergence (ROC)**. This region determines the range of $z$ values for which the Z-transform converges. The ROC is crucial in determining the stability and causality of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:theorem}\n",
    "**Region of Convergence**: Given a discrete-time sequence $x[n]$ and its Z-transform $X(z)$, the Region of Convergence (ROC) is the set of values of $z$ for which $X(z)$ converges:\n",
